# HOTFIXES
Hotfixes are nessecary, because not all messages are generated properly.

## "generator/msg/hotfix"-Folder:
(Because some cases are not handled with the parser at the moment.)
```
In the "hotfix"folder are messages for scenarios which are not handled with the parser at the moment.
A python-file replaces the original files with the adapted files from the "hotfix"-folder.
In each message-file you can find a short description what has been changed manually.
```
